        <h1>About This App</h1>
        <p>
            This app was developed to give users personalized clothing suggestions based on the weather in a specific city that they search. 
            We use real-time data from Weatherstack, Open-meteo, and the National Weather Service so users can visualize current weather, air quality, future weather trends, and clothing recommendations
            with visual examples. Our mission is to help remove uncertainty associated with weather related attire and to make everyone's daily life more convenient. If you are traveling, don't 
            know what clothes to wear, or simply just want to know what the weather is going to be in your area, then this app is for you!
